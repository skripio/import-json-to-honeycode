1. Create an EC2 instance, Jupyter notebook instance, or just use your Mac. Run the script `JsonGenerator.py`. Currently, it creates "Captains ratings." 
2. Create a Kinesis firehose using the Kinesis UI. use the same name that is in `JsonGenerator.py`.
3. Create a S3 output bucket. The Firehose will dump a file to this bucket aggregating random time series data.
  - The data will be a text file. See the root directory for a sample input.
4. Create a trigger Lambda function. For the handler, use `ImportLambda.py`. Ensure it has HoneycodeFullAccess and S3FullAccess permissions so it can run properly.
5. Create a Honeycode workbook with a single table. Create an App that reveals this time series data.


Areas of improvement:
- Move to public Lambda application so it can be easily reused
- Create CloudFormation template for easy full stack deployment
